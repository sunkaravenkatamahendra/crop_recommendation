✅ Predicts the best crop based on input parameters✅ Uses Google Gemini AI for intelligent recommendations✅ Simple & user-friendly Streamlit UI✅ Takes real-time inputs for Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, Temperature, Humidity, pH, and Rainfall✅ Provides a brief explanation for the recommended crop

🛠 Tech Stack

Python 🐍

Streamlit 🎨 (for UI)

Google Gemini AI 🤖 (for ML-based recommendations)

Joblib 📦 (if model storage is needed in the future)

🎯 How It Works?

The user enters values for soil and climate conditions.

The system sends a prompt to Google Gemini AI.

The AI processes the data and returns the best crop recommendation.

The recommendation is displayed on the UI with a brief explanation.
